# 100 - Introduction

I (Isaac Johnson) have been using Ghost to blog for some amount of time, but recently I was turned onto Jekyll for blogging with markdown.  More to the point, Jekyll is the backend used by Github Pages blogging.  We can actually use this and a custom DNS entry to make a free scalable blog, documentation portal or website.
