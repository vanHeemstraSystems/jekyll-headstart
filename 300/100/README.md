# 100 - Getting Started

First, let's create a root level repo for our blog. It needs to match our org or user id and end in 'github.io'.

In my case, ```vanHeemstraSystems.github.io```:

![create-repo-with-github-io](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1499433/183773027-830497cd-0468-4a85-83b7-ba4787d8ad7b.png)

Notice, in my case this repo already existed.

You'll also want to set it to public if you want people to be able to see it.

https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/jekyll-headstart/issues/2#issue-1333857158

In my case it is already public.

At this point, technically we are done with the MVP. There now exists a very basic GH Pages site:

Notice, i a previous attemp, I already did some styling and edited some text.
