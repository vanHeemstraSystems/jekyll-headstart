# 100 - Getting Started

First, let's create a root level repo for our blog. It needs to match our org or user id and end in 'github.io'.

In my case, ```vanHeemstraSystems.github.io``` (will be automatically turned into lower-case):

Notice, in my case this repo already existed.

You'll also want to set it to public if you want people to be able to see it.

In my case it is already public.

At this point, technically we are done with the MVP. There now exists a very basic GH Pages site at https://vanheemstrasystems.github.io:

Notice, i a previous attemp, I already did some styling and edited some text.
