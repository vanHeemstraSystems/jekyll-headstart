# 100 - Getting Started

First, let's create a root level repo for our blog. It needs to match our org or user id and end in 'github.io'.

In my case, ```vanHeemstraSystems.github.io```:

![create-repo-with-github-io](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1499433/183773027-830497cd-0468-4a85-83b7-ba4787d8ad7b.png)

Notice, in my case this repo already existed.
