# 200 - Themes

Under settings, we can easily pick from some standard themesâ€¦  Here you can chose a theme, for example "Midnight Theme".

Notice, there is a warning that choosing a theme may break manual configuration which we did earlier on the GitHub Pages for this repository. Hence, leave the theme as is for now.

Should you make changes save it with e.g. a README.md, it will rebuild and republish the site.
